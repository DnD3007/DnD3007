#### I'm Dimitris, a full stack web developer.
  
💻 Computers were always my passion. I remember myself when I was at school trying to find some time to escape to the only one computer room we had so I could stay in front of a blank screen and watching, as I couldn't do anything else (lack of knowledge 😢).

👨‍🎓 I did my first computer training in 1990 at Omega College, a Greek college in the heart of Athens. Since then I have had many online and classroom courses. I started with some (now obsolete) languages like Cobol, Pascal and Basic. When the Internet became popular, my interest in creating websites was so strong that I could not resist entering this world.

🌱  My passion for knowledge and development led me to even more courses. Right now as I write I'm improving/expanding my knowledge with the following:

🇬🇷 I am originally from Greece but I live in 🇬🇧 UK since 2004. I have British citizenship with a British passport and full rights to live and work in UK.

🥅 My goal is to be able to work as a Web Developer so that I can turn my passion into energy as it is impossible for me to see it as a mandatory job. So if this sounds interesting to you please do not hesitate to contact me.
