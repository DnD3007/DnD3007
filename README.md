### 👋 Hi, I'm Dimitris – a Potential App Developer
  
💻 Ever since school, I’ve been drawn to computers. I still remember sneaking into the computer lab just to sit in front of a blank screen—fascinated, even though I didn’t yet know how to use it. That early curiosity has grown into a lifelong passion for technology and learning.

👨‍🎓 My journey began in 1990 with my first computer training at **Omega College in Athens, Greece**. Since then, I’ve completed many classroom and online courses. I started with now-retired languages like **COBOL**, **Pascal**, and **BASIC**, but when the internet became mainstream, I knew web app development was where I belonged.

🎓 I’m currently studying **MSc Computer Science and Data Analysis at Keele University (UK)**, further deepening my understanding of both software development and data-driven technologies.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Here are some of the technologies I work with:

🌱 I love continuous learning and regularly build projects to sharpen my skills and explore new ideas.

🌍 Originally from Greece 🇬🇷, I’ve been living in the UK 🇬🇧 since 2004. I hold British citizenship and have full working rights in the UK.

🎯 My goal is to work professionally as a web developer—to turn a lifelong passion into a meaningful career. For me, development isn't just a job; it's something I genuinely enjoy and feel energized by.

📬 Feel free to connect or reach out—I'm always open to collaboration or opportunities!
